Influential Person Website
This will be a multipage site in Vanilla JS. My project's influential person is the pokemon Ditto. The site needs to be responsive, minimum 4 pages including 1 page about why they are an influence, and it's designed using boostrap, CSS, and HTML.

        Ditto (Japanese: メタモン Metamon) is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
        It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.
        Ditto is well-known for its unique ability to breed with any Pokémon other than the Pokémon in the No Eggs Discovered group and other Ditto, including some gender-unknown Pokémon, to produce Eggs of the other's species.
        <br><br>
        In its natural state, Ditto is a light-purple or pink blob-like Pokémon with vestigial facial features. It is often referred to as amorphous, but has a relatively consistent appearance in official artwork, including two small nubs on its "head", a few soft lumps at its base, and two pseudopod-like protrusions in place of arms. The face consists of beady eyes and a simple mouth; almost always pulled into a smile.
        <br><br>
        It is capable of transforming into an exact replica of any physical object or living creature, including its form and abilities. Each Ditto has its own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to transforming; being unable to remain transformed while laughing and getting details of its transformation wrong if based on memory being apparently universal.
        <br><br>
        Ditto is never far from civilization or people, and is the only Pokémon capable of using the Metal Powder and Quick Powder items. Its variety of unusual and often entirely unique traits set it apart from every other Pokémon.
